I-TASSER server is an internet service for protein structure and function
predictions. It allows acedemic users to automatically generate
high-quality predictions of 3D structure and biological function of protein
molecules from their amino acid sequences. The I-TASSER package is a
stand-alone version of the I-TASSER server that differs in some respects in
terms of its workflow, while allowing researchers to use local computing
resources rather than relying on the server provided by the University of
Michigan.
