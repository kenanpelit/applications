codons are predicted and scored along the sequence using Position Weight Arrays (PWAs). In the second step, 
exons are built from the sites. Exons are scored as the sum of the scores of the defining sites, plus the 
log-likelihood ratio of a Markov Model for coding DNA. Finally, from the set of predicted exons, the gene 
structure is assembled, maximizing the sum of the scores of the assembled exons. geneid offers some type of 
support to integrate predictions from multiple source via external gff files and the redefinition of the
