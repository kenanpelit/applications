FSL has been modified to work with LoadLeveler job submission. 
Several files have been modified and these need to replace the original files

eg:

FSLDIR=/share/apps/FSL/noarch/5.0
CONFDIR=$FSLDIR/etc/fslconf


# Copy files over
cp -f fsl.sh $CONFDIR/fsl.sh
cp -f feat $FSLDIR/bin/feat
cp -f fsl_sub $FSLDIR/bin/fsl_sub
cp -f randomise_parallel $FSLDIR/bin/randomise_parallel

Note than in order for the integration to work, llwait needs to be built and placed on the user PATH
llwait source can be found in the 'other' directory under applications/FSL
