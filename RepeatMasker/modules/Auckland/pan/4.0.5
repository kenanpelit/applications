#%Module

module-whatis {RepeatMasker is a program that screens DNA sequences for interspersed repeats
  and low complexity DNA sequences. The output of the program is a detailed annotation of the
  repeats that are present in the query sequence as well as a modified version of the query
  sequence in which all the annotated repeats have been masked (default: replaced by Ns).
  On average, almost 50% of a human genomic DNA sequence currently will be masked by the program.
  Sequence comparisons in RepeatMasker are performed by one of several popular search engines
  including, cross_match, ABBlast/WUBlast, RMBlast and Decypher.}
