Abaqus FEA (formerly ABAQUS) is a suite of software applications for finite element analysis and computer-aided engineering,
originally released in 1978. The Abaqus product suite consists of five core software products:

    * Abaqus/CAE, or "Complete Abaqus Environment" (a recursive acronym and backronym with an obvious root in Computer-Aided Engineering). It is a software application used for both the modeling and analysis of mechanical components and assemblies (pre-processing) and visualizing the finite element analysis result. A subset of Abaqus/CAE including only the post-processing module can be launched independently in the Abaqus/Viewer product.
    * Abaqus/Standard, a general-purpose Finite-Element analyzer that employs implicit integration scheme (traditional).
    * Abaqus/Explicit, a special-purpose Finite-Element analyzer that employs explicit integration scheme to solve highly nonlinear systems with many complex contacts under transient loads.
    * Abaqus/CFD, a Computational Fluid Dynamics software application which provides advanced computational fluid dynamics capabilities with extensive support for preprocessing and postprocessing provided in Abaqus/CAE.
    * Abaqus/Electromagnetic, a Computational electromagnetics software application which solves advanced computational electromagnetic problems.

The Abaqus products use the open-source scripting language Python for scripting and customization.
Abaqus/CAE uses the fox-toolkit for GUI development.
